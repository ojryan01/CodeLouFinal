    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>The rich traditions of Ireland can be appreciated by people of all backgrounds. The goal of the Ryan Academy of Irish Dance is to pass on this beautiful culture to a new generation of artists through music and dance, and to encourage students to share their talents with others. I believe that the showcasing of these skills, whether in community venues or on the competitive stage, instills invaluable traits such as confidence, poise, sportsmanship, focus and determination in the dancer. Through Ceili (group) and Solo dance instruction, I will strive not only to preserve the centuries-old art form that is Irish dance, but also to enrich the community and foster the grace and integrity of every student.</p>
